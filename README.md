New firmware supporting SMTP SSL one can get either by [Simcom](https://simcom.ee/documents/SIM900/1137B06SIM900M64_ST_ENHANCE.RAR) or by [TinySine](http://www.tinyosshop.com/download/1137B05SIM900M64_ST_ENHANCE.rar) for example. To upload it use the "Simcom - sim900 Customer flash loader". Simcom does not provide it, but the some retailers, like [TinySine, do](http://www.tinyosshop.com/download/sim900%20Customer%20flash%20loader%20V1.01.rar).
